# Here's what the tech stack looks like:

Frontend: Rust, Leptos/WebAssembly

Backend: Rust, Leptos (For rendering html on the server) + Axum/Tokio + Tower (tracing, compression, etc)

Scripting: Python

## Libraries 
- leptos (Rust)
- web-sys (Rust)
- axum (Rust)
- tokio (Rust)
- tower-http (Rust)
- serde (Rust)
- polars (Rust)
- polars (Python)
- matplotlib (Python)
- OpenCV (python)

## Methodology
Backend executes python scripts for plotting and cv, performing the remaining calculations in rust
